<h1>Upgrading Libraries</h1>

<h2>If you were using an earlier version of TapLynx...</h2>

<h3>TapLynx is now just one library</h3>

<p>In the past, the TapLynx library was two libraries &mdash; one for simulator and one device. Now there&rsquo;s just one libTapLynx library (which works for both simulator and device).</p>


<h3>Quattro no longer supported</h3>

<p>Though Quattro ads were supported in earlier versions of TapLynx, they are no longer supported &mdash; since Quattro was acquired by Apple, and they&rsquo;re concentrating on iAds instead. (We&rsquo;re on the case. It&rsquo;s high on the to-do list.)</p>
<p>If you still need Quattro ads, you can use TapLynx 1.3.4 and Xcode 3.2.2 (or earlier).</p>


<h3>Medialets and Flurry</h3>

<p>There are new versions of the libraries for Medialets and Flurry which are compatible with iOS 4. You may need to download those and replace your current copies with the new versions.</p>

<p>See their respective websites for the new versions of the libraries.</p>
