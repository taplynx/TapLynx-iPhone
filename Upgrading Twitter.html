<h1>Upgrading Twitter</h1>

<h2>If you were using an earlier version of TapLynx...</h2>

<p>You didn&rsquo;t have to do anything special to make posting to Twitter work.</p>

<p>But Twitter has changed the way their system works, and apps that want to post to Twitter need to do a few things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register with Twitter. Start at <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/">dev.twitter.com</a>.</li>
<li>Get a consumer secret and consumer key. You&rsquo;ll get these when you register.</li>
<li>Email Twitter and ask them to enable xAuth access for your app. See <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/xauth">this page for the email address</a> where you can send your request. Explain to them that you have an iPhone app that posts to Twitter. You can even mention TapLynx if you want.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Configuration in TapLynx</h4>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done the above, then you&rsquo;ll need to add your consumer secret and consumer key to your app.</p>

<p>In Xcode, select the main.m file. You should see a section that looks like the below. (If you don't see it, copy and paste it in. You can get a copy from main.m in the sample iPhoneApp that comes with TapLynx.)</p>

<pre>@interface TLSecrets : NSObject
+ (NSString *)twitterConsumerKey;
+ (NSString *)twitterConsumerSecret;
@end

@implementation TLSecrets
+ (NSString *)twitterConsumerKey {
	//key goes between quotes, as in: return @"46wBr2ArP5rcHH0ZRyNpu";
	return @"";
}
+ (NSString *)twitterConsumerSecret {
	//secret goes between quotes, as in: return @"rYfjQY5fNzzSJ4ywSSrdUROse9a7Wh8dtuN0Ogf6m";
	return @""; 
}
@end</pre>

<p>Put your consumer secret and consumer key between the quotes, as described in the comments (lines that start with //) above. (Congratulations! You've just written some Objective-C code!)</p>

<h4>What happens if you haven&rsquo;t done the above yet</h4>

<p>You can test posting-to-Twitter in the simulator. It uses a default consumer secret and key for TapLynx.</p>

<p>But those TapLynx keys won&rsquo;t work on the device. For post-to-Twitter to work on a device, you&rsquo;ll need your own consumer secret and key.</p>
