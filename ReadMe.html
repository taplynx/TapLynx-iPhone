<h1>Welcome to TapLynx</h1>

<p>TapLynx is a library that makes building news and media iPhone apps very easy.</p>
<p>No programming is required. Configure the application via a property list file, add artwork and feeds, and build it.</p>
<p>This means you can iterate over the <em>design</em>, not the programming.</p>
